4. Implement language switcher component
5. Add E2E tests for language switching

**Deliverables:**

- Working EN/DE routing
- Type-safe translation helper
- Language switcher in navigation

---

### Priority 3: Automation

**Why Last:** Requires all above infrastructure to be in place

**Tasks:**

1. Configure semantic-release
2. Create GitHub Actions workflow
3. Set up automated testing in CI
4. Configure automated deployment
5. Test full CI/CD pipeline

**Deliverables:**

## 💡 Key Technical Decisions

### 1. No-Mocks Testing Approach ✅

**Decision:** Use Astro Content Collections for test data instead of mocking libraries

**Rationale:**

- Mocks drift out of sync with real APIs (maintenance burden)
- Tests fail when real data format changes = catch real issues
- Simple, Astro-native approach
- Zero mocking libraries needed
- JSON files serve as both production data AND test data

**Impact:** Easier maintenance, more reliable tests, simpler codebase

---

### 2. Tailwind CSS v4 (Not v3) ✅

**Decision:** Use latest Tailwind CSS v4 instead of stable v3

**Rationale:**

- Better Vite integration
- CSS-based configuration (no JS config)
- Smaller bundle size
- Native CSS features support
- Latest best practices

**Impact:** Modern, performant, future-proof styling system

---

### 3. Clean Architecture for Frontend ✅

**Decision:** Implement Clean Architecture principles adapted to Astro

**Rationale:**

- Swappable data sources (JSON now, Strapi later)
- Testable business logic isolated from UI
- Clear separation of concerns
- Industry-proven pattern for scalability

**Impact:** Easier to maintain, test, and extend as project grows

---

### 4. Conventional Commits (Enforced) ✅

**Decision:** Require conventional commit format via commitlint

**Rationale:**

- Clear git history for debugging
- Automated changelog generation
- Enables semantic-release automation
- Industry standard

**Impact:** Professional git history, automated versioning ready when needed
